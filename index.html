        <p class="border rounded-0 border-dark"><br>I am a Software Engineering Boot Camp Graduate at HyperionDev. I am also a part-time Bachelor of Sciences in Mathematics and Computer Science Student at the University Of South Africa. I have a deep interest in Software and Tech as an industry. It has become the key industry that shapes what we do, how we think, how we go about our daily lives. Tech has broken boundaries over the past 3 decades, tech companies have become superpower companies, larger in cap more than most of the "normal" Fortune 500 companies combined. It is an industry at the forefront of everything, it is such a vast and ever-changing industry. There are more "levels " and opportunities in the tech industry than any industry in history. It caterers for all interests, It has vastly improved our way of life and it is an industry I love with all my heart.<br><br></p>
        <p class="border rounded-0 border-dark"><br>My journey with Software Engineering has been a difficult yet very fulfilling one, the thrill that comes with seeing something come to life, all from an idea, to a fully functioning program is unmatched. albeit at the cost of your sanity more often than not, but the end is always so rewarding. Yes, you haven't showered in a day or so, you have doubted your existence, questioned your intelligence, drank more cups of coffee and energy drinks, that are enough to power up a small "car". But the end result is always so fulfilling, the feeling you get when you finally run your program and everything clicks and works efficiently, the smirk you have on your face, the superpowers you now think you have, that feeling... that is irreplaceable, that feeling gives me life... to be one with the Matrix.<br><br></p>
        <p class="border rounded-0 border-dark"><br>I am looking to gain more technical experience developing Software that can help enterprises, businesses, and clients work faster and better. I am looking to add on and use the experience I have gained through the Software Engineering boot camp. Apply that knowledge to companies that can apply it to a better scale than I can. I am interested in growing my skills as a software developer and working on building software that makes business processes simpler and better. I have a keen interest in learning more about cloud-based software development and management thereof. I also have a keen interest in understanding more about Machine Learning and Artificial Intelligence and how they can be used to better improve businesses processes and client software development.<br><br></p>
